                      RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR USING JAVASCRIPT

I have created an application that a user can use to generate a strong random password that provides greater security based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

Criteria:

Password Length (8-128 characters)
Include Uppercase Letters 
Include Lowercase Letters 
Include Numbers 
Include Special Characters
 
 
 The user can then click the Generate Password button that will display the random password that matches the user's selected criteria.
